# Introduction
This project introduces a CRM system for arbitrage teams. Among notable features are:
1. `Leads` tracking and management: `leads` are virtual entities with user details, like `User-Agent`, `IP`, `Referrer`.
   They simulate the tracking of a user's journey to a specific landing page. Currently, they are gathered as a simple
   `post` requests, but this functionality will be adjusted to tracking of `get` requests through the small tracking
   image, embedded into the landing page. Thus, it will be possible to track real-life visits of users to landing pages.
   Also, each lead has a `user_id` property, which makes it possible to track the specific team member responsible for
   the lead. As a result, users, or `Buyers` to be precise, can monitor their own performance.
2. `Orders` tracking and management: `orders` are virtual entities, that simulate the filling of order form by user.
   Each `order` is derived from a `lead`, therefore providing the opportunity to track the performance of the concrete
   `leads` source. Currently, `orders` are gathered as `post` requests. However, under real-life conditions, they can
   be collected using an order form on the landing page.
3. Management of `teams`: each team has several `Buyers` and a `Team Lead`. `Team Lead` can assess the team performance
   and act accordingly. Currently, all related functionalities are under active development. As of now, the corresponding
   API request processing features have been implemented. All API requests to `teams`-related endpoints require 
   authorization. Authorization is being performed through JWT. Corresponding HTML frontend is currently under development.
4. User management: there are several roles in the system - `Buyer`, `Team Lead`, `Funds Coordinator`, and `Owner`.
   Each with its own set of permissions and responsibilities. The distinct separation between these roles is under 
   development. 
5. `Leads`, `Orders`, `Teams`, `Users` management is performed through API, however, also a user-friendly frontend 
   which showcases listings of `leads` and `users` is available. Each user's page provides a detailed listing of `leads`
   generated by them. `Users` and `leads` can not only be viewed, but also created, updated, and deleted. HTML-templates
   for other functionalities are under active development.
6. A bonus feature of this system is the comprehensive Admin section. It is intended for owners or superusers, providing
   them with a platform where they can manage and control any aspect of the system as desired. While the 'usual' frontend
   management through HTML templates is currently under development, the 'admin' section is already fully equipped with
   all necessary features to manage all available entities within the system.
7. In addition to this, all API requests can be tested using Swagger for a streamlined and efficient testing process. 
   All endpoints displayed on the Swagger page are fully functional. In the 'Usage' section below, some endpoints
   are documented. However, due to ongoing active development, the most accurate information about available 
   functionalities can be found directly through Swagger.
# Installation
1. Python3 must be installed. If not, please, visit https://www.python.org/ and choose appropriate version for your OS.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the cloned folder using the `cd` command:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/luxuriant777/CRM-system-for-arbitrage-team
   ```
   ```shell
   cd CRM-system-for-arbitrage-team
   ```
3. Switch to the `dev` branch:
   ```shell
   git checkout dev
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment - this is a separate container where all the necessary dependencies will be
installed:
   ```shell
   venv\Scripts\activate (on Windows)
   ```
   ```shell
   source venv/bin/activate (on macOS)
   ```
5. Install all the necessary packages:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Apply migrations:
   ```shell
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
7. Create a superuser. You will be asked to provide a username, email (optional), and password:
   ```shell
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
   A superuser account can be used to log in to the Django administrative interface and perform administrative tasks.
8. Create the necessary groups and permissions with this command:
   ```shell
   python manage.py check
   ```
9. You can start the development server by running:
   ```shell
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   Then you will be able to access the administrative interface by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` in your web 
   browser.
# Usage
## 1. Asynchronous processing of `leads` and `orders` creation
   To enable the simultaneous storage of multiple `lead` or `order` creation requests, it is necessary to install
   RabbitMQ and start `celery`. Assuming, that you have [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) installed, run the
   following command in the command prompt or bash while in the root folder of the project:
   ```bash
   celery -A crm_arbitrage worker --loglevel=info -P eventlet
   ```
   This action is mandatory in order to be able to accept `leads` and `orders`. If `Celery` is not up and running, the
   `leads` and `orders` will not be written to the database.
## 2. To register a user (a team member):

1. Open Postman and enter this URL:
   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/users/register/
   ```
2. Select the HTTP method as "POST".

3. Click on the "Body" tab below the URL field.

4. Select the "raw" option and choose "JSON" from the dropdown menu.

5. In the request body, provide the JSON payload containing the username, email, and password. For example:
    ```json
    {
      "username": "example_user",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "password": "secretpassword"
    }
    ```
6. Click the "Send" button to send the request.
7. Postman will send the POST request to the specified URL with the provided JSON payload. You should receive a 
   response indicating whether the user registration was successful or any errors that occurred. If the registration
   was successful, you will see:
    ```json
    {
        "message": "User registered successfully.",
        "user": {
            "username": "example_user",
            "email": "user@example.com"
        }
    }
    ```
## 3. To login as a registered user:

1. Open Postman and enter this URL:
   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/users/login/
   ```
2. Select the HTTP method as "POST".

3. Click on the "Body" tab below the URL field.

4. Select the "raw" option and choose "JSON" from the dropdown menu.

5. In the request body, provide the JSON payload containing the username and password. For example:
    ```json
    {
      "username": "example_user",
      "password": "secretpassword"
    }
    ```
6. Click the "Send" button to send the request.
7. Postman will send the POST request to the specified URL with the provided JSON payload. You should receive a 
   response indicating whether the user login was successful or any errors that occurred. If the login was successful,
   you will see this:
    ```json
    {
        "message": "User logged in successfully.",
        "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNjg1OTc0MTQ3LCJpYXQiOjE2ODU5NzM4NDcsImp0aSI6ImZkZTE2NWZjZmQyZDRkOTJhY2FjNmQ1NTQyODBlZGQwIiwidXNlcl9pZCI6MiwicGF5bG9hZCI6eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyLCJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImV4YW1wbGUifX0.F4y3hLbOk3UcJBoSKZIaZvGO2HtXCghgy7vszq4mIuM"
    }
    ```
   The `access_token` should be used to make requests to all endpoints that require authorization.

## 4. To list all registered users:

1. Open Postman and enter this URL:
   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/users/list/
   ```
2. Select the HTTP method as "GET".

4. Select the "Bearer Token" option and enter the `access_token` you received when performed the login request. 
   For example:
   ```
   eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNjg1OTc0MTQ3LCJpYXQiOjE2ODU5NzM4NDcsImp0aSI6ImZkZTE2NWZjZmQyZDRkOTJhY2FjNmQ1NTQyODBlZGQwIiwidXNlcl9pZCI6MiwicGF5bG9hZCI6eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyLCJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImV4YW1wbGUifX0.F4y3hLbOk3UcJBoSKZIaZvGO2HtXCghgy7vszq4mIuM
   ```
5. Click the "Send" button to send the request.
6. Postman will send the GET request to the specified URL. You should receive a response with the list of all registered
   users, or message with errors that occurred. If the request was successful, you will see this:
    ```json
   [
       {
           "id": 1,
           "username": "example_user",
           "email": "user@example.com"
       },
